## Part 3 - Command Line Navigation

My OS is:
- [x] Windows
- [] Linux
- [] Mac

My Command Line Shell is: 
wsl2 ubuntu bash
### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory: /home/bodie
2. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`:mkdir "Dir B"
4. Go into `DirA`:cd DirA
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd ../"Dir B" asked geeks4geeks how to go into another directory while in one 
6. Return to your user's home directory:cd ~
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: touch test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: mv test.txt DirA/
9. Contents of `test.txt`:
``` was empty but added using echo "" > DirA/test.txt 
Put your words here
``` 
Aura
luminescent
quantavious
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: cp DirA/test.txt DirA/copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`: ls DirA contents are copy.txt test.txt
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`:cp DirA/test.txt "Dir B/fodder.txt"

13. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`: rm "dir B" and rm fooder.txt couldnt get both at same time
